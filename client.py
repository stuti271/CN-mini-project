#The first steps of the client are to choose a nickname and to connect to our server. We will need to know the exact address and the port at which our server is running.

# Choosing Nickname
nickname = input("Choose your nickname: ")

# Connecting To Server
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client.connect(('127.0.0.1', 55555))
#As you can see, we are using a different function here. Instead of binding the data and listening, we are connecting to an existing server.

#Now, a client needs to have two threads that are running at the same time. The first one will constantly receive data from the server and the second one will send our own messages to the server. So we will need two functions here. Let’s start with the receiving part.

# Listening to Server and Sending Nickname
def receive():
    while True:
        try:
            # Receive Message From Server
            # If 'NICK' Send Nickname
            message = client.recv(1024).decode('ascii')
            if message == 'NICK':
                client.send(nickname.encode('ascii'))
            else:
                print(message)
        except:
            # Close Connection When Error
            print("An error occured!")
            client.close()
            break
#Again we have an endless while-loop here. It constantly tries to receive messages and to print them onto the screen. If the message is ‘NICK’ however, it doesn’t print it but it sends its nickname to the server. In case there is some error, we close the connection and break the loop. Now we just need a function for sending messages and we are almost done.

# Sending Messages To Server
def write():
    while True:
        message = '{}: {}'.format(nickname, input(''))
        client.send(message.encode('ascii'))
#The writing function is quite a short one. It also runs in an endless loop which is always waiting for an input from the user. Once it gets some, it combines it with the nickname and sends it to the server. That’s it. The last thing we need to do is to start two threads that run these two functions.

# Starting Threads For Listening And Writing
receive_thread = threading.Thread(target=receive)
receive_thread.start()

write_thread = threading.Thread(target=write)
write_thread.start()
